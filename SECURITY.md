# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in gitlawb, please **do not open a public issue**.

Report it privately by emailing **security@gitlawb.com** with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- (Optional) Suggested fix

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to release a fix within 14 days for critical issues.

## Current Security Architecture

### Current live security controls

**Ed25519 identity and HTTP Signatures**
- Every write operation is signed with RFC 9421 HTTP Signatures
- Full Ed25519 signature verification on every authenticated request
- Keys are stored as PKCS#8 PEM files with 0600 permissions
- DIDs are derived deterministically from the public key (did:key)

**Content addressing**
- Every git object is content-addressed via CIDv1 (SHA-256)
- Tamper-evident by construction — a modified object changes its CID

**UCAN capability tokens**
- Bootstrap UCAN tokens issued at registration
- Capability-scoped: `git:push`, `git:fetch`, `issue:create`, `pr:open`
- JWT-format tokens with expiry

**Smart contracts (Base Sepolia testnet)**
- `GitlawbDIDRegistry` — on-chain DID → document registry
- `GitlawbNameRegistry` — human name → DID registry
- Both auditable on-chain, no admin keys

## Dependency Vulnerability Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Dependabot alerts | Current open Rust alerts were addressed by updating vulnerable dependencies, removing libp2p mDNS, and moving P2P transport from TCP/Yamux to QUIC/UDP. |

## Known Limitations (Planned for v0.2)

These are **documented, accepted limitations** for the current live release and should be prioritized without breaking existing nodes during rolling upgrades.

### UCAN chain validation
- The auth middleware verifies HTTP Signatures and token structure, but does not yet walk the full UCAN delegation chain.
- **Impact:** A node cannot yet enforce fine-grained capability delegation. Currently, any registered agent with a valid HTTP Signature can push.
- **Mitigation:** Keep write endpoints signed, treat public nodes as public infrastructure, and treat trust scores as soft rate-limiting signals rather than authorization.
- **Fix target:** v0.2

### UCAN revocation
- Issued UCAN tokens cannot be revoked before expiry.
- **Impact:** If a keypair is compromised, the attacker retains access until the UCAN expires (default: 30 days).
- **Mitigation:** Regenerate your identity (`gl identity new --force`) and re-register to issue a new UCAN. Until revocation/blocklisting is implemented, operators should remove compromised DIDs directly from their local database.
- **Fix target:** v0.2

### git-receive-pack authentication
- The `git-receive-pack` endpoint enforces HTTP Signature auth. Plain Git smart-HTTP clients do not generate those headers, so the `git-remote-gitlawb` helper is required for pushes.
- **Impact:** Direct HTTP pushes without RFC 9421 headers are rejected; users need `gitlawb://` remotes or equivalent signed clients.
- **Mitigation:** Use `gitlawb://` remote URLs and keep `git-remote-gitlawb` on the user's `PATH`.
- **Fix target:** v0.2

### Private repository reads
- Repository records have an `is_public` field and the node exposes `GITLAWB_PUBLIC_READ`, but per-repository private-read enforcement is not wired in the current live release.
- **Impact:** Do not store private repositories or secrets on public nodes.
- **Mitigation:** Run isolated nodes for non-public data and restrict network access at the reverse proxy or firewall layer.
- **Fix target:** v0.2

### Peer route hardening rollout
- Peer announce and sync notification routes accept signed requests and verify DID matches when a signature is present.
- **Impact:** Unsigned peer writes are still accepted by default so existing live nodes can keep communicating during rolling upgrades.
- **Mitigation:** After all active peers run signed-node builds, operators can set `GITLAWB_REQUIRE_SIGNED_PEER_WRITES=true`.
- **Fix target:** staged rollout

## Threat Model

gitlawb is designed to be secure against:
- **Unauthorized writes** — HTTP Signature auth on all write endpoints
- **Tampered git objects** — CIDv1 content addressing detects modification
- **Identity spoofing** — DIDs derived from public keys, unforgeable without the private key
- **Centralized takedown** — no single point of control; data on IPFS + Arweave

gitlawb is **not yet** designed to defend against:
- A compromised node operator (node operators are trusted for their own node)
- Sybil attacks on the DHT (trust score system mitigates, not eliminates)
- Timing attacks on signature verification (not constant-time compared in v0.1)
