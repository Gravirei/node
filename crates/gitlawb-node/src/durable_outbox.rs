//! #26 Split PR 1 — durable post-receive outbox: the recovery drain.
//!
//! This module owns the STARTUP drain for `pending_ref_transitions`. It
//! iterates every row in state `applied`, re-derives the push event, the
//! per-ref certificate, and the anchor handoff using the ORIGINAL pusher
//! DID and signature header that was persisted BEFORE the receive-pack
//! call landed the ref, and then deletes the row.
//!
//! The drain is invoked once at startup, after migrations and before
//! serving, in [`crate::main`]. It is also the function the failure-
//! injection end-to-end test calls to simulate a "node restart" after
//! the crash window the reviewer flagged.
//!
//! Idempotency is delegated to the DB layer. The push event and anchor
//! job use `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` keyed on the deterministic
//! `(request_id, ref_name)` / `(repo_id, ref_name, old_sha, new_sha)`
//! id. The ref certificate uses an idempotent insert that checks the
//! unique `(repo_id, ref_name)` index and returns `None` if a live-path
//! cert already exists. Re-running the drain against the same row is
//! therefore a no-op for the artifact writes; the row deletion at the
//! end is also idempotent because a missing `id` simply affects zero
//! rows.

/// Promote `prepared` rows whose `new_sha` matches the on-disk ref to
/// `applied`, so the recovery drain (which only reads `state =
/// 'applied'`) picks them up on the next pass. The reconcile runs at
/// startup, BEFORE the drain.
///
/// This is the second half of the P1-A fix. The first half is the
/// live handler's `mark_pending_ref_transitions_applied` call, which
/// can fail or be interrupted AFTER `receive_pack` returned `Ok`. A
/// `prepared` row whose target ref actually landed on disk has no
/// recovery path without this step: the drain's WHERE clause does not
/// see it, and a startup that boots and serves traffic would silently
/// lose the push event, the cert, and the anchor handoff for that
/// ref.
///
/// Strict SHA equality is the load-bearing correctness check. A row
/// whose `new_sha` does NOT match the on-disk ref stays `prepared`;
/// the invariant "a failed receive-pack is never promoted to
/// completed accounting" is preserved by the equality check, not by
/// state alone. A `cancelled` row is also never promoted (the
/// `list_pending_ref_transitions_prepared` SELECT gates on
/// `state = 'prepared'`, and the UPDATE re-checks the state).
///
/// The SHA check alone is not sufficient. A `prepared` row could
/// have a `new_sha` that currently matches the on-disk ref for a
/// reason OTHER than its own transition (e.g. a later push
/// re-introduced the same SHA on the same ref). To prevent the
/// recovery drain from writing artifacts for a transition the node
/// cannot prove actually happened, the reconcile ALSO requires the
/// row's `created_at` to be within [`MAX_RECONCILE_AGE`] of the
/// current time. Rows older than the window are left `prepared` for
/// human-attended recovery. This is the second correctness barrier,
/// and the reason a `prepared` row that happens to match a current
/// on-disk SHA does not silently turn into completed accounting.
///
/// P1 (reviewer round 3, second half): the SHA check plus the age
/// window is still not landing PROOF. The reviewer's case is
/// `old = B, new = A` on a ref that was ALREADY sitting at A — which
/// is not an exotic coincidence but the ordinary shape of a REJECTED
/// push, because git refuses an update whose expected old value does
/// not match the ref. Both checks pass, the push never happened, and
/// the drain would sign a certificate for it.
///
/// The live path answers this from git's `report-status` body; that
/// body is long gone by the time the reconcile runs, so the proof is
/// re-derived from the repository itself: the ref's REFLOG must carry
/// an entry whose `<old> <new>` pair is exactly this row's, stamped at
/// or after the row was written (see [`reflog_proves_landing`]). That
/// is git's own record of the ref MOVING the way the row claims, after
/// the intent was durable, which is precisely what a coincidental tip
/// cannot produce.
///
/// Deletions are fail-closed with a terminating attended lifecycle:
/// git removes a ref's reflog with the ref, so no reflog entry can prove
/// a deletion was caused by this request. Reconcile quarantines deletion
/// rows (cancelling siblings) instead of promoting them; an operator
/// resolves via `resolve_attended_request`.
///
/// No reflog means NO PROOF, and no proof means no promotion — the row
/// stays put and is logged for human-attended recovery.
/// [`crate::git::store::init_bare`] turns `core.logAllRefUpdates` on
/// for every repo this node creates (bare repos default it off), so
/// the gap is repos predating that. Deliberate trade: a stranded row
/// an operator can see beats accounting the node cannot substantiate.
