    // The methods below own the producer/persistence/restore boundary the
    // reviewer flagged: every externally visible ref transition has a row
    // here before the receive_pack call, the row's state reflects the
    // outcome (`applied` on Ok, `cancelled` on Err), and a startup drain
    // re-derives the push event, ref certificate, and anchor handoff for
    // any `applied` row. Recovery is idempotent because every derived
    // artifact has a deterministic id (see `*_id_for` above) and the
    // `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` clause collapses a
    // re-fired transition to a no-op.
    //
    // The handler is responsible for calling `insert_prepared` before the
    // `smart_http::receive_pack` call and `mark_applied` / `mark_cancelled`
    // after. The `drain_applied` method is called once at startup, after
    // migrations and before serving. Wiring those into the handler is
    // tracked as the next slice of work; this commit adds the durable
    // boundary and the DB-level idempotency the handler will lean on.

    /// Insert one `prepared` row per ref update in the push, returning the
    /// rows as persisted. Called from the receive-pack handler BEFORE
    /// `smart_http::receive_pack` runs.
    ///
    /// `request_id` is the per-handler UUID; the same value must be used
    /// for every ref update in a single push, and it becomes the
    /// deterministic seed for the push event, ref cert, and anchor job
